          Collision strengths form Watts & Burke (1998)

       Only limited data for Nickel is available. The oscillator values 
       presented here are take from extensive calculations of
       Kurucz.
       
       NIST energy levels have been used where available.

       Photoionization cross-sections are very crude hydrogenic vales based
       on nef. These need to be updated. 

       The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
       They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
       the optimum choice of super levels.
