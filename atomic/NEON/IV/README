26/Jan/14 - Fixed incorrect name in collisional data file.

Use phot_nosm
    NB: (phot_sm_3000.dat has smoothed opacity data
            Cross-sections for level with no opacity data also differs from phot_nosm)
    NB: Bug fix (16-Aug-2010) for 2s2_2p2(3Pe)10h_4Go state (had wrong phot ID).
             Ony important if using almost all the levels.
