       Only limited data for Cl V is available. The oscilator values 
       presented here are bsically that for ArVI. They have been scaled 
       accoridng to the difference in z, and transition wavelength.
       
       NIST energy levels for Cl VI were inserted, and LS coupling assumed
       to split the transition vales. Kurucz oscilator vaules were then
       substituted, if available.

       Photoionization cross-sections are very crude hydrogenic vales based
       on nef. (A better alternate might be to use the cross-sections for
       ArVI)

       The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
       They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
       the optimum choice of super levels.
