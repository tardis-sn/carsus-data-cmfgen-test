       Only limited data for Potassium is available. The oscilator values 
       presented here are take from extensive calculations of
       Kurucz.
       
       NIST energy levels have been used where available.

       Photoionization cross-sections are very crude hydrogenic vales based
       on nef. These need to be updated. 

       The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
       They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
       the optimum choice of super levels.
