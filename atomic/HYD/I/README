     These are the recommended hydrogen data for 99% of all
     applications.

     These are the hydrogen data to use when you want to
     allow for the l states to be treated as individual levels.
     This may be important in some models at low electron densities
     (i.e., Ne < 10^10). At present, states n=1 to 4 are split into 
     individual l levels. 

     Two collisional files are available:

        hicol_a4.dat:   Contains cross-section for collisions with electrons.
                        These are satisfactory, except for the l changing
                        collisions. For l changing collisions, charged ions
                        (e.g., protons) are mmore important.

        hicol_a4_p.dat: The cross-section for the l-changing collisions have 
                        been replaced with the proton cross-section, which are 
                        typically an order of magnitude larger than the
                        corresponding electon-cross sections. This can be
                        used for models in which H dominates. An approximation,
                        since collisions with charged ions have not yet been
                        implemented.

      If you use this data, STARK profiles cannot (YET) be used in CMF_FLUX.
