Line Broadening
  For hydrogen 3 set of line-broadening functions are currently implemented.
     RECOMZ -- Broadening theory due to Griem.
                 Generally okay except for n to n+1 transitions.
     Lemke  -- Problem with IR transitions.
                 Very similar to BS when both are available.
