   Preferred data set. Data set is much more extenisve than earlier
   data sets. In grid calculations, all levels are not needed.
   However, at some Teff's (e.g., Teff = 34000K) these high levels
   (which don't necessarily have observed energies) may need to
   be included.

  Oscillator strengths are from Kurucz.
  NIST energy levels inserted.
  Photoionization data is from the OPACITY project, where available.
  Collisional data is from Pradhan's group.
  Forbiden transitions are included.

  Preferred data files are:
    col_data.dat
    Fevi_osc.dat
    phot_sm_3000.dat

  The file, phot_hydro.dat, is not (generally) to be used.
  It contains crude photoioization cross-section which 
  can be compared, in model calculatons, against the
  more accurate values given in phot_sm_2000.dat.

  The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
  They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
  the optimum choice of super levels.
        
  NB: In general there is little effective difference with
      small data set for the levels in common. A few misidentified
      levels may have been corrected.
