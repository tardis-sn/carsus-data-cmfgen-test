  For the oscilator strengths use
       feiv_osc_rev.dat
  reather than  feiv_osc.dat. Two oscilator strengths in this file
  were reduce by a factor fo 10, and this seems to give less problem with the
  HeI singlet lines.

  There was a probelm with the FeIV photoioization cross-sections
  for low lying terms. This is now fixed, and the updated
  file supecedes the old file. The old file was renamded
  bad_phot_sm_3000.dat.

  Preferred data set. Data set is much more extenisve than earlier
  data sets. In grid calculations, all levels are not needed.
  However, at some Teff's (e.g., Teff = 34000K) these high levels
  (which don't necessarily have observed energies) may need to
  be included.

  Oscillator strengths are from Kurucz.
  NIST energy levels inserted.
  Photoionization data is from the OPACITY project, where available.
  Collisional data is from Pradhan's group.
  Forbiden transitions are included.

  The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
  They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
  the optimum choice of super levels.
        
  NB: In general there is little effective difference with
      small data set for the levels in common. A few misidentified
      levels may have been corrected.
