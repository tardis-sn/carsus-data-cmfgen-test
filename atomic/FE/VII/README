   Preferred data set. Data set is much more extenisve than earlier
   data set. In grid calculations, all levels are not needed.
   It is has not yet been determined at what temperatures these high
   levels (which don't necessarily have observed energies) may need to
   be included in flux calculations.

  Oscillator strengths are from Kurucz.
  NIST energy levels inserted.
  Photoionization data is from the OPACITY project, where available.
  
  No collisional data are yet available. As a consequence we have 
  not included Forbidden transitions occuring among the low lying
  even parity states.
  
  The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
  They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
  the optimum choice of super levels.
        
  NB: In general there is little effective difference with
      small data set for the levels in common. A few misidentified
      levels may have been corrected.
