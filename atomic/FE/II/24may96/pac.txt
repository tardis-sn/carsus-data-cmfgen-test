Hi Paul,

The following EMAILS contains 3 link file for Fe2.

I have been using 827_to_62 but only 510 levels. I'm about to run a full
  FeII atom.

I have run a LS coupling model also. While the populations change
a lot at some depths, the predicted spectrum is very similar. Thus
I would tend to use the 62 super-level model and then confirm the calculations 
using less superlevels later.

John
