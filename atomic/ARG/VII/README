       f values and photoioizationcross-section are from the oapcity
       project.  NIST energy levels inserted, and LS coupling assumed
       to split the transition vales.

       The f_to_s_?.dat files have been created using WR_F_TO_S.
       They have not been checked, and do not necassarily provide
       the optimum choice of super levels.
